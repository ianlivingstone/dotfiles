# Ian Livingstone's Dotfiles

Modern, secure dotfiles with machine-specific configuration support. Built for developers who work across multiple machines with different identities and keys.

## ✨ What You Get

### 🚀 **Modern Development Environment**
- **Zsh** with Starship prompt showing git status, language versions, and system info
- **Neovim** with LSP, autocompletion, fuzzy finding, and syntax highlighting
- **Tmux** for terminal multiplexing and session management
- **Git** with security-first configuration and helpful aliases

### 🔒 **Security by Default**
- **GPG signing** required for all commits and tags
- **SSH key management** with proper per-machine configuration
- **HTTPS-only** curl commands with modern TLS requirements

### 🖥️ **Multi-Machine Support**
- **Different Git identities** per machine (work email vs personal email)
- **Different SSH keys** per machine (work keys vs personal keys)  
- **Different GPG keys** per machine for commit signing
- **Clean separation** between shared config and personal data

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ianlivingstone/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

# 2. Run the installer (handles everything!)
./dotfiles.sh install

# 3. Restart your shell
exec zsh
```

The installer will:
- ✅ Check for required dependencies and show install commands if missing
- ✅ Prompt for your Git name and email for this machine
- ✅ Detect and let you select SSH keys to use
- ✅ Detect and let you select a GPG key for commit signing
- ✅ Configure everything automatically

## 🔧 Dependencies

The installer checks for these and provides install commands if missing:

**Required Tools:**
```bash
brew install stow starship luarocks ripgrep neovim tmux
```

**Development Managers:**
```bash
# Node.js version manager
curl -o- --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Go version manager  
bash < <(curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)

# Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## 🛠️ Management Commands

```bash
./dotfiles.sh install      # Install/configure dotfiles (interactive)
./dotfiles.sh status       # Check installation status
./dotfiles.sh uninstall    # Remove all dotfiles symlinks  
./dotfiles.sh help         # Show all available commands
```

## 📁 What Gets Installed

- **Shell configuration** → `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zprofile`
- **Git configuration** → `~/.gitconfig` (with machine-specific includes)
- **SSH configuration** → `~/.ssh/config` (with machine-specific includes)
- **Tmux configuration** → `~/.tmux.conf`
- **Neovim configuration** → `~/.config/nvim/`
- **Starship prompt** → `~/.config/starship.toml`

**Machine-specific configs** are stored in `~/.config/git/` and `~/.config/ssh/` (never in git repo).

## 🎯 Key Features

### 📊 **Smart Shell Status**
Every new shell shows a one-line summary:
```
🏠 user@hostname ~/directory | ⏱ uptime | 📦 git-branch ✓ | 🕐 time
```

### 🎨 **Intelligent Prompt** 
- **Language versions** automatically displayed (Node.js, Go, Python, Rust, Java)
- **Git status** with clean indicators (✓ clean, ± dirty, ⇡ ahead)
- **Context awareness** for Docker, Kubernetes, AWS when relevant

### ⚡ **Powerful Editor**
- **LSP integration** for TypeScript, Go, Python, and more
- **Fuzzy finding** for files, text search, and buffers (`<Space>ff`, `<Space>fg`)
- **Smart autocompletion** with context-aware suggestions
- **Auto-formatting** and import organization on save

### 🔐 **Security & Identity Management**
- **Per-machine Git identities** (different name/email per machine)
- **Per-machine SSH keys** (work keys vs personal keys)
- **Required GPG signing** for all commits and tags
- **Secure defaults** for all network operations

## 🏗️ Architecture

This dotfiles system uses a **layered configuration approach**:

- **Base configurations** live in this git repository (shareable settings)
- **Machine-specific data** lives in `~/.config/` (private, never in git)
- **Native tool includes** handle the layering (Git `[include]`, SSH `Include`)

For detailed information about the design principles and architecture decisions, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🤝 Customization

Fork this repository and modify to your needs! The modular package structure makes it easy to:
- Add new tools by creating new package directories
- Remove tools by excluding them from the `PACKAGES` array in `dotfiles.sh`
- Customize existing configurations by editing the files in each package

The separation between shared and machine-specific configuration means you can safely share your fork while keeping personal data private.
