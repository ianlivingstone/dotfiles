# GPG Agent Configuration Template
# 
# This file serves as documentation for GPG agent settings.
# The actual ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf is generated dynamically by dotfiles.sh
# with auto-detected pinentry program paths.
#
# Configuration includes:
# - Auto-detected pinentry program (pinentry-curses preferred, fallback to pinentry-tty, then pinentry)
# - 8-hour cache timeout (24-hour max)
# - SSH support enabled
# - Security hardening (no external cache)
#
# Do not edit ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf directly - it will be overwritten.
# Modify the generation logic in dotfiles.sh instead.
